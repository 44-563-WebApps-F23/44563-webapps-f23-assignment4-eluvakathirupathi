        <h1>Thirupathi Eluvaka acts in a play</h1>
        <h3>An Enemy of the People, by Henrik Ibsen</h3>
        <p>(SCENE.â€”A big old-fashioned room in CAPTAIN HORSTER'S house. At the
            back folding-doors, which are standing open, lead to an ante-room.
            Three windows in the left-hand wall. In the middle of the opposite wall
            a platform has been erected. On this is a small table with two candles,
            a water-bottle and glass, and a bell. The room is lit by lamps placed
            between the windows. In the foreground on the left there is a table
            with candles and a chair. To the right is a door and some chairs
            standing near it. The room is nearly filled with a crowd of townspeople
            of all sorts, a few women and schoolboys being amongst them. People are
            still streaming in from the back, and the room is soon filled.)
