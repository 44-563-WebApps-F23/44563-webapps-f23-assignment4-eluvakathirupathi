        <h1>Thirupathi Eluvaka acts in a play</h1>
        <h3>An Enemy of the People, by Henrik Ibsen</h3>
         
        <p> <h4 class="name firstcitizen">1st Citizen.</h4>
        <p>That doesn't matter; Dr. Stockmann's not the chap to be
afraid.</p></p>

<p><h4 class="name thirdcitizen">3rd Citizen.</h4>
<p>3rd Citizen. But he is in the wrong; it said so in the “People’s
    Messenger.”</p></p>

    <p><h4 class="name secondcitizen">2nd Citizen.</h4><p> Yes, I expect he must be in the wrong this time, because neither
the Householders’ Association nor the Citizens’ Club would lend him
their hall for his meeting.</p></p>
